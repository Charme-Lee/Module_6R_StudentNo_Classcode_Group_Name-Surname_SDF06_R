## Project Overview

This project highlight the foundation of Css and Html I have learned thus far. The objective was to create a user friendly "instagram clone for pets" using flexbox and grid as layouts for alignment and responsiveness.

To enhance user experience, I implemented a loading animation using a the border property and ensured all interactive elements, such as buttons, are easily accessible and visually appealing. I used these element to illustate the learnings I picked up to date.

I thought it would be great to add a touch of reels, tags and the photo grid icons above the gallery content to mimic instagram slighlty.

Additionally, I utilized semantic HTML for better SEO and accessibility, making sure the application is usable across various devices. The excersice was challenging especially on the concept of media quaries but via googling and trial and error I made some head way.
